I am Ph.D. candidate at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, with main research interest in international economics. Recently I have focused on the simulation and empirical research of dynamic spatial structure models, my collaborators and I are using this model to analyse the impact of a quasi-natural experiment on economic and trade.
